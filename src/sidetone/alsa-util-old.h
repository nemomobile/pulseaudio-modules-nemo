/* Currently the upstream offers only pa_alsa_open_mixer_for_pcm() for opening
 * an alsa mixer handle, which isn't usable in the "alsa-old" modules, because
 * they must not open the pcm handle before the first stream connects, and the
 * aforementioned _open_mixer_for_pcm() requires an opened pcm handle. This
 * function only requires the name of the device that needs to be opened.
 *
 * The code behind this function is mostly copied from 0.9.15, which is why
 * this file is called alsa-utils-old.h.
 *
 * Returns NULL on failure. */
